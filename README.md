> A professional, browser-powered web scraper built on Scrapy and Playwright. Capable of bypassing modern bot-protection systems and exporting clean, structured data in three formats simultaneously.

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🖥️ **Live Browser View** | Watch the browser navigate pages in real-time as the scraper runs |
| 🧠 **Human-like Simulation** | Random mouse movement, smooth scrolling, and natural wait times to evade detection |
| 🛡️ **Anti-Bot Bypass** | Automatically bypasses Cloudflare, SiteGround Captcha, and similar protection systems |
| 📦 **Triple Export** | Outputs CSV + JSON + SQLite on every single run |
| 🧹 **Smart Data Cleaning** | Splits compound fields (prices, durations, dates) into separate, structured columns |
| ⚙️ **Fully Configurable** | Control the target URL, selectors, and extraction mode entirely via `config.yaml` |

## 📖 Usage

### 1️⃣ General Web Scraping
Edit `config.yaml` with your target URL and run:
```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe main.py
```

### 2️⃣ Scrape a Custom List of Links
To scrape detailed content for pages listed in `menu_links.json`:
```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe run_specialties.py
```

### 3️⃣ Clean & Structure Raw Data
To split compound fields (e.g. `14000 MYR • 3 Years • Feb Intake`) into separate columns:
```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe process_courses.py
```

## ⚙️ Configuration — `config.yaml`

```yaml
target_url: "https://example.com/listing/"   # The page to scrape
base_url: "https://example.com"

output:
  project: "my_project"    # Output folder name
  folder: "results"        # Sub-folder name
  filename: "output"       # Output file base name
  csv: true
  json: true
  sqlite: true

extraction_mode: "list"    # "list" for tables/cards, "sections" for heading-based pages
```
